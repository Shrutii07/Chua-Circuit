# Chua-Circuit

Chaos Theory is a branch in mathematics, which deals with dynamic systems, involving a highly sensitive reaction of the output given a slight change of the input. Here, this is demonstrated using a well known circuit known as Chua's Circuit. Basically, it is a nonperiodic oscillator, that it, it produces an output waveform that never repeats. It is also known as the "paradigm of chaos". The implementation was done by replacing the Chua's Diode using transistors and opamps. The simulation is done using Ngspice. Feel free to raise issue or contact the contributors in case of any doubts or development of this code.
